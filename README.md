Simple and effective extension to download Songs, Albums, or Playlists from [jioSaavn.com](https://jioSaavn.com) with just one click. It also hides ads and promotions from JioSaavn Web and slightly tweaks the UI. Last but not least, it implements long-awaited **dark mode**.

## How It Works

It fetches data from the API endpoints of JioSaavn, organizes them in a useful manner. All this happens within the browser and does not rely on external servers.

After Fetching data it gets the URL of the song, album, or playlist in your desired quality settings. Then it creates an HTTP request to the server to fetch the M4A file. This step requires the CORS to be enabled in your browser. In previous builds, it requires you to use another extension, but in newer builds, it is baked in.

In the case of a Playlist or an Album, it fetches the songs in the playlist and then downloads them one by one and puts them inside a zip file to download at once.

  Helped to make the extension completely standalone, adn remove requirement of any proxy server.

  Gave the concept of the JioSaavn API.

Their Projects help me a lot in developing this extension.
