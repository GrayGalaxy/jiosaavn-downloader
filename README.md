> This extension is still in the works. It is not yet ready for production use. It is still in the early stages of development. Many features are missing and bugs are still being worked on.
>
> The Download is working right but currently the files have _no metatags_, and downloading depends on _CORS_ so you need to enable it in your browser using extensions.

## How It Works

It fetches data from the API endpoints of JioSaavn, organizes them in a useful manner. All this happens within the browser and does not rely on external servers.

After Fetching data it gets the URL of the song, album, or playlist in your desired quality settings. Then it creates an HTTP request to the server to fetch the M4A file. This step requires the CORS to be enabled in your browser.

In the case of a Playlist or an Album, it fetches the songs in the playlist and then downloads them one by one and puts them inside a zip file to download at once.
