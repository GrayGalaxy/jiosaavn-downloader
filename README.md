## How It Works

It fetches data from the API endpoints of JioSaavn, organizes them in a useful manner. All this happens within the browser and does not rely on external servers.

After Fetching data it gives out a MP3 file with neatly organized tags and album art with the help of `ID3.js`

  <small>
  Note: <strong>Developer mode</strong> is required to enable the extension. You can see a toggle button promptly named "Developer Mode". Turn on to enable the Developer mode.<br>
  You might get a **Turn off Developer Mode** notification every time you open the browser if you are using Stable versions of chrome. You can use Chrome Dev or Canary if that notification annoys you.
