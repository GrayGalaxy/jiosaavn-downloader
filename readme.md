## How It Works

It fetches data from the api endpoints of JioSaavn, organizes them in useful manner. All this happens within the browser and does not rely on external servers.

After Fetching data it gives out MP3 file with neatly organized tags and album art with the help of `ID3.js`

## Behind the Scenes

The extension just fetches data from the JioSaavn server for necessary links to download the songs. Then it grabs the song in mp3 format from the backend services.

Make sure you check out [JioSaavn API][a1] and [Jiosaavn Downloader Extension][a2] repo and :star: it if you like. People do not earn a penny from this and spend their precious time developing it and release it for free. A small praise, a good mention makes them feel good and it doesn't cost anything. See right sidebar for the list of contributors to the repo.

### Dependencies

- [JQuery][d1] - To simplify code
- [ID3 JS][d2] - To add tags to downloaded files
- [JS Zip][d3] - To create zip file for Playlists or Albums

### How it works

#### Song

- When you press a download button on song it fetches data of song from the JioSaavn server to provide Links, Title, Album etc.
- Then it will send a request to this [custom API endpoint][a3] and generate a download URL from server.\
  <small>This helps to avoid CORS errors if we try to fetch from browser</small>
- Then it will download the song asynchronously in background. as the download song will have a gibberish name and no song details.
- Then it will download the album art asynchronously.
- Finally it will add ID3 tags (Title, Singer, Cover, Composer and stuff) to the downloaded song.

#### Album, Playlist

- On clicking the Download button it fetches lists of songs from server to download.
- Then it downloads the songs one by one as mentioned above.
- For playlists it also downloads the featured image if available.
- We will make a virtual zip on memory and create a folder and add the songs there.
- Finally you can Download the Zip file.
